# rf-deter_aims
This is the RF-DETR project, which I have modified specifically, including model export, model testing, etc. These modifications are mainly tailored for my actual industrial inspection project. Note: Currently, the official ONNX export does not support dynamic axes for batch_size, so all exports in this repository use static axes.
